	* libwfut/types.h, libwfut/IO.h, libwfut/IO.cpp, libwfut/WFUT.cpp: Add
	  checks for CRC32 value calculation. The IO::queueFile now takes the 
	  expected CRC32 value of the downloaded file. Set to 0 to ignore the 
	  calculated CRC32 value.

	* libwfut/IO.cpp: Fix poll function so download failures are reported 
	  as such. Fix queueFile to set DataStruct as private data for the 
	  handle. The low-level file download code is now fairly complete,
	  however some work is required for better error handling.
