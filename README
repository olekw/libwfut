 libwfut
=========

libwfut is a C++ implementation of the client side of WFUT (forge/tools/WFUT). The aim of this library is to provide update capabilities for C++ based clients.#
This library used tinyxml (http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/) to parse the XML documents and libcurl (http://curl.haxx.se/) to download files.

Currently this library is in its early stages with XML document parsing written, however file downloading is not yet complete.

 Planned Architecture
----------------------

libwfut is planned to have a polling interface to allow background downloads. A few basic methods will download channels lists and file lists which can be used to queue files for downloading. Calling poll() will then download a portion of the current file before returning control back to the application.

 Example Usage
---------------

WFUT::ChannelList channels = WFUT::getChannels("http://white.worldforge.org/downloads/WFUT/channels.xml);

WFUT::FileList files = WFUT::getFiles("http://white.worldforge.org/downloads/WFUT/sear-media.xml");

WFUT::queueFiles(files);

while (WFUT::hasFiles()) {
  WFUT::poll();
}
